## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Route group conflicts with existing auth
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of auth flows in both sections

- **Risk**: Performance impact from animations
- **Mitigation**: Use CSS transforms and will-change properties

- **Risk**: Docker build size too large
- **Mitigation**: Multi-stage builds and dependency optimization

### Timeline Risks
- **Risk**: Design iterations taking too long
- **Mitigation**: Start with MVP design, iterate post-launch

- **Risk**: API integration complexity
- **Mitigation**: Mock APIs initially, integrate incrementally
