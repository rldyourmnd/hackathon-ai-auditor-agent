# Extensions monorepo (boilerplate)

This directory contains starter scaffolding for the browser and VS Code extensions and shared packages.

Structure added (minimal boilerplate):

- packages/core
- packages/ui
- packages/messaging
- packages/shared
- apps/browser-ext
- apps/vscode-ext

This is a lightweight scaffold intended to follow the repository rules for layered architecture.
